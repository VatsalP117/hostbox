# Hostbox Onboarding

This guide is **implementation-first**. It describes what is in the repository today, where the important code lives, how the pieces fit together, and where the current gaps are.

It is intentionally more honest than aspirational:

- some parts of the backend are fairly complete
- some parts of the frontend and API have drifted apart
- automated checks exist, but end-to-end behavior is **not yet proven**

If you are starting to contribute, read this before trusting `SPEC.md` or the phase plans in `docs/`.

---

## 1. What Hostbox is today

Hostbox is a self-hosted deployment platform aimed at static/frontend apps. The main runtime is:

1. **Hostbox API**: a Go/Echo server
2. **SQLite**: embedded app database
3. **Docker**: used to build user projects in isolated containers
4. **Caddy**: separate reverse proxy and static file server
5. **React dashboard**: frontend under `web/`
6. **CLI**: separate Go binary under `cmd/cli`

At a high level, the intended flow is:

1. user creates a project
2. Hostbox triggers a deployment
3. worker clones repo and builds it in Docker
4. artifact is copied to `deployments/`
5. Caddy is updated to serve that artifact on preview/production URLs

That flow exists in code, but some surrounding pieces are incomplete or mismatched.

---

## 2. Current confidence level

This repo is **not yet a trusted end-to-end product**.

What currently looks strong:

- Go backend structure
- SQLite migrations and repositories
- worker/build pipeline shape
- Caddy config generation and sync services
- GitHub webhook plumbing

What currently lowers confidence:

- frontend and backend response/route mismatches
- setup/auth flow drift
- production dashboard serving appears incomplete
- no browser end-to-end tests
- some documented features are still TODOs or stubs

From the current checkout:

- `go test ./...` passes
- Docker images build
- frontend build succeeds in Docker
- frontend lint is **not green** in local CI-style execution

Treat the project as **implemented enough to understand and improve**, but **not yet validated enough to assume it works as a hosted product**.

---

## 3. Suggested reading order

Read these files in roughly this order:

1. `cmd/api/main.go`
2. `internal/config/config.go`
3. `internal/api/server.go`
4. `internal/api/routes/routes.go`
5. `internal/repository/`
6. `internal/services/auth.go`
7. `internal/services/deployment/service.go`
8. `internal/worker/executor.go`
9. `internal/services/caddy/`
10. `internal/services/github/`
11. `web/src/app.tsx`
12. `web/src/hooks/`
13. `cmd/cli/cmd/`

If you want the shortest “mental map”, start with:

- `cmd/api/main.go`
- `internal/worker/executor.go`
- `internal/services/caddy/builder.go`
- `web/src/app.tsx`

---

## 5. Runtime architecture

### API startup flow

`cmd/api/main.go` wires the server in this order:

1. load config from environment
2. setup logger
3. open SQLite
4. run migrations
5. create repositories
6. create auth/backup/notification/update services
7. initialize Docker client
8. initialize Caddy client + config builder + sync service
9. optionally initialize GitHub App integration
10. create Echo server
11. create handlers
12. initialize build executor + worker pool if Docker is available
13. start background schedulers
14. register routes
15. start HTTP server and graceful shutdown hooks

Important consequence: **Docker is optional at startup**, but without it the build pipeline is effectively disabled.

### Database

Hostbox uses **SQLite in WAL mode** via `internal/database/sqlite.go`.

Migrations are embedded from `migrations/*.sql` and applied on startup. Core tables include:

- `users`
- `sessions`
- `projects`
- `deployments`
- `domains`
- `env_vars`
- `notification_configs`
- `activity_log`
- `settings`

The repositories under `internal/repository/` are the main source of truth for data access.

### HTTP server

`internal/api/server.go` creates the Echo server and attaches:

- request ID middleware
- structured request logging
- panic recovery
- CORS
- security headers
- custom JSON error handling

Route registration happens in `internal/api/routes/routes.go`.

### Build pipeline

The main build logic lives in `internal/worker/executor.go`.

The current flow is:

1. fetch deployment + project
2. create a build log file and SSE stream
3. mark deployment as `building`
4. clone repo
5. detect framework / package manager / Node version
6. create Docker build container with resource limits
7. run install + build commands
8. copy build output into the deployment artifact directory
9. mark deployment `ready`
10. run post-build hooks (Caddy + notifications)

The worker pool in `internal/worker/pool.go` handles queueing, panic recovery, crash recovery, and orphaned container cleanup.

### Caddy integration

`internal/services/caddy/` is responsible for generating and pushing Caddy config through the admin API.

Important files:

- `builder.go`: builds full Caddy JSON config
- `client.go`: talks to Caddy admin API
- `sync.go`: full sync on startup and periodic sync
- `manager.go`: route-level updates for individual deployments/domains

Caddy serves:

- the platform hostname
- production project routes
- branch-stable routes
- preview deployment routes
- verified custom domains

### GitHub integration

`internal/services/github/` contains:

- App auth/token management
- webhook event routing
- push handling
- pull request handling
- installation handling

This part is optional and only initializes when GitHub App config is present.

---

## 6. Backend API surfaces

Main route groups from `internal/api/routes/routes.go`:

### Public

- `GET /api/v1/health`
- `GET /api/v1/setup/status`
- `POST /api/v1/setup`
- auth routes: register, login, refresh, forgot-password, reset-password, verify-email

### Authenticated

- `/projects`
- `/deployments`
- `/domains`
- `/env-vars`
- `/auth/me`

### Admin

- `/api/v1/admin/stats`
- `/api/v1/admin/activity`
- `/api/v1/admin/users`
- `/api/v1/admin/settings`
- `/api/v1/admin/backups`
- `/api/v1/admin/update/check`

### Optional GitHub

- `POST /api/v1/github/webhook`
- `GET /api/v1/github/installations`
- `GET /api/v1/github/repos`

For contributor work, the important handlers are:

- `internal/api/handlers/auth.go`
- `internal/api/handlers/setup.go`
- `internal/api/handlers/projects.go`
- `internal/api/handlers/deployments.go`
- `internal/api/handlers/domains.go`
- `internal/api/handlers/env_vars.go`
- `internal/api/handlers/admin.go`

---

## 7. Frontend architecture

The dashboard lives in `web/`.

### Main structure

- `web/src/app.tsx`: router and top-level providers
- `web/src/main.tsx`: React entrypoint
- `web/src/hooks/`: API-facing React Query hooks
- `web/src/stores/auth-store.ts`: Zustand auth store
- `web/src/components/`: UI and feature components
- `web/src/pages/`: route-level pages

### Frontend stack

- React 18
- React Router
- TanStack Query
- Zustand
- Tailwind
- Radix UI / shadcn-style components
- React Hook Form + Zod

### Auth model

The frontend keeps the access token in Zustand and tries to bootstrap auth by calling the refresh endpoint and then `/auth/me`.

Main files:

- `web/src/stores/auth-store.ts`
- `web/src/hooks/use-auth.ts`
- `web/src/components/shared/auth-guard.tsx`
- `web/src/components/shared/setup-guard.tsx`

### Important reality check

The frontend exists and is substantial, but **it is not fully aligned with the backend contract right now**. See [Known implementation gaps](#12-known-implementation-gaps) below before assuming the dashboard works end to end.

---

## 8. CLI architecture

The CLI is a separate Go app under `cmd/cli`.

Key pieces:

- `cmd/cli/cmd/root.go`: root command and global flags
- `cmd/cli/internal/client/client.go`: HTTP client
- `cmd/cli/internal/config/config.go`: local CLI config/token storage
- `cmd/cli/internal/link/`: `.hostbox.json` project link handling

Implemented command groups include:

- `login`, `logout`, `whoami`
- `projects`, `project create`
- `link`
- `deploy`, `status`, `logs`, `rollback`
- `domains`
- `env`
- `admin`

The CLI is useful for understanding the intended API usage, but it is not feature-complete. For example, `hostbox logs` explicitly says real-time SSE log streaming is not fully wired for the CLI.

---

## 9. Local development

You have two realistic ways to work on the codebase.

### Option A: run services directly

#### Backend

```bash
go mod download
CGO_ENABLED=1 go run ./cmd/api
```

#### Frontend

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Important note about environment variables

The Go app reads directly from the process environment in `internal/config/config.go`. It does **not** load `.env` automatically.

That means:

- `.env` is useful for Docker Compose
- `go run ./cmd/api` needs exported env vars in your shell

At minimum you need valid values for:

- `JWT_SECRET`
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- `PLATFORM_DOMAIN`

For purely local API work, something like this is enough:

```bash
export JWT_SECRET="dev-secret-dev-secret-dev-secret-1234"
export ENCRYPTION_KEY="0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"
export PLATFORM_DOMAIN="localhost"
export PLATFORM_HTTPS="false"
export DATABASE_PATH="./data/hostbox.db"
export LOG_LEVEL="debug"
export LOG_FORMAT="text"
```

### Option B: Docker Compose

#### Dev compose

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

This intends to start:

- Go API on `:8080`
- Caddy on `:80/:443`
- frontend dev server in a Node container

#### Current caveat

`docker-compose.dev.yml` exposes frontend port `5173`, but `web/package.json` runs Vite on port `3000`. That means the current dev compose frontend wiring looks inconsistent and should be treated as suspicious until fixed.

---

## 10. Production packaging

Production runtime is defined by:

- `docker/Dockerfile`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `docker/caddy/Dockerfile`

### What the Dockerfile does

1. build the frontend in `web/dist`
2. build the Go API binary
3. build the Go CLI binary
4. package the binaries into an Alpine runtime image

### Important packaging mismatch

The docs describe a production binary that embeds and serves the React dashboard, but the current implementation does **not** appear to do that:

- `docker/Dockerfile` copies `web/dist` into the Go build context
- but there is no actual `go:embed` or static file serving implementation in the API server
- Caddy’s platform route currently reverse proxies the platform hostname to the API upstream

So, as the code stands, **production dashboard serving looks incomplete or missing** even though the build pipeline produces frontend assets.

This is one of the biggest doc-vs-implementation mismatches in the repo.

---

## 11. Testing and validation

### Existing automated checks

GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs:

- `go vet ./...`
- `go test -v -race ./...`
- Go builds for API and CLI
- frontend lint
- frontend type-check
- frontend build
- Docker image builds

### What is missing

- no browser end-to-end tests
- no deployment smoke tests against a running VM
- no verified “push repo, get working preview URL” test flow in the repo
- no contract tests between frontend and backend

### Practical takeaway

You should trust:

- unit-level backend behavior more than UI behavior
- Docker image buildability more than full platform usability

You should not assume:

- the dashboard works fully
- the onboarding/setup flow works fully
- production serving works fully

---

## 12. Known implementation gaps

These are the main things a contributor should know before diving in.

### 1. Frontend and backend contracts have drifted

Examples:

- `web/src/hooks/use-projects.ts` expects `GET /projects/:id` to return:
  - `project`
  - `latest_deployment`
  - `domains`
- but `internal/api/handlers/projects.go` returns only:
  - `project`

More mismatches:

- `web/src/types/api.ts` expects domain/env-var list wrappers like `domains` / `env_vars`
- `internal/api/handlers/domains.go` and `internal/api/handlers/env_vars.go` return `data`

Route mismatches also exist:

- frontend verify domain path differs from backend verify route
- frontend delete domain path differs from backend delete route
- frontend rollback/redeploy hooks target different paths than backend exposes

This is the single biggest source of likely UI breakage.

### 2. Setup flow is inconsistent

The setup/status API and frontend do not line up cleanly:

- backend exposes `GET /api/v1/setup/status`
- `web/src/hooks/use-setup-status.ts` incorrectly posts to `/setup`
- `web/src/components/shared/setup-guard.tsx` expects `setup_complete`
- backend status handler appears to model setup as `setup_required`

Also, `internal/api/handlers/setup.go` sets a refresh cookie but does **not** persist a session record the same way the normal auth flow does. That means first-run auth/session behavior is not something you should assume is correct.

### 3. Production dashboard serving appears incomplete

As noted above:

- the frontend is built during Docker image creation
- but the Go server does not appear to embed or serve those static files
- and Caddy proxies the platform hostname to the API

This suggests the dashboard is currently reliable mainly as a dev app, not as a proven production-served UI.

### 4. Domain verification is stubbed

`internal/api/handlers/domains.go` returns **501 Not Implemented** for verification.

The domain model and Caddy route code exist, but verification flow is not fully implemented at the API layer.

### 5. Email flows are not complete

`internal/services/auth.go` contains TODO behavior for password reset email sending. Reset token generation exists, but SMTP-driven delivery is not really finished.

### 6. Some deployment follow-up flows are partial

`internal/services/deployment/service.go` still contains TODOs around route updates for rollback/promote flows.

The build pipeline and post-build hook integration are present, but not every deployment lifecycle path is fully wired.

### 7. Frontend local quality gate is not green

In current local CI-style execution, frontend lint fails, including errors in:

- `web/src/types/api.ts`
- `web/tailwind.config.ts`

That matters because it means the frontend is currently not in a fully clean contributor state.

---

## 13. How to contribute effectively right now

If you want to make meaningful progress quickly, the best first contribution areas are:

### A. Fix frontend/backend contract drift

Good files to compare side by side:

- `internal/api/handlers/*.go`
- `web/src/hooks/*.ts`
- `web/src/types/api.ts`

This is probably the highest-leverage contributor task.

### B. Make local dev reliable

Likely tasks:

- fix dev frontend port mismatch
- document a known-good native dev flow
- add a simple smoke-test script for API + frontend

### C. Repair setup/auth onboarding

Focus files:

- `internal/api/handlers/setup.go`
- `internal/services/auth.go`
- `web/src/hooks/use-setup-status.ts`
- `web/src/components/shared/setup-guard.tsx`

### D. Finish production dashboard serving

This likely requires one of:

- actually embedding `web/dist` into the Go binary and serving it
- or changing Caddy/runtime wiring so the built dashboard is served correctly

### E. Add end-to-end confidence

The repo would benefit heavily from:

- API smoke tests against a running instance
- deployment smoke tests
- browser tests for setup/login/project creation

## 15. Bottom line

Hostbox is **not just a spec**. There is real backend, worker, Docker, Caddy, GitHub, frontend, and CLI code here.

But it is also **not yet a coherent, battle-tested product**. The main thing to understand as a contributor is:

- the backend architecture is fairly real
- the dashboard exists, but has contract drift
- some “it should work like Vercel” surfaces are not fully wired
- the fastest path to making the project usable is reducing the gap between code paths that already exist

If you contribute with that mindset, you will make much faster progress than if you assume the docs already describe a working system.
